## Travel Tracker
A final project for Mod 2 - Design an app that can manage and track a user's travel using a provided API.

## Usage
Welcome to your personal Travel Tracker! Upon visiting the site, a user is greated by a login screen. After entering the correct credentials, the user's dashboard appears. Users can view their yearly spending on travel, as well as upcoming, past trips, and any trips that may be pending a travel agent's approval.

## How to Install
fork the repository

git clone it down to your command line

Navigate into the repository on your machine

Run npm install

git clone the travel api repo

Run npm install

To view the site, run npm start in both repos


To login to the site:
Username: traveler + any number 1 - 50 (ex: traveler36)
Password: travel

## Planning
I utilized GitHub Projects for project management as well as the detailed spec.


## Challenges
I developed a testing suite for this app to ensure Travelers and Trip objects were being instantiated correctly. I would like to have explored sad path testing further and perhaps in future would attempt to design more sad paths into the functions themselves.
A major challenege in this project was accessing and manipulating api data correctly. After determining exactly what needed to be accessed and subsequently stored, the process seemed to make more sense.
I found error handling on api calls to also be tricky, however, after some careful consideration, I created user friendly error handling for any bad responses. I would like to find better error handling for users upon a .catch firing.
## Wins
I felt my files were organized well and make sense when reading through the code.
I feel I have a solid grasp on all the concepts included in the project - from the DOM manipulation and error handling, fetch calls, functions and their testing process. I was able to use iterator methods frequently and efficiently and with the help of the project management board, felt I had an overall control of the project and my plan from beginning to end.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your project_, then you can consider deploying your project to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your project to the web. Don't worry about this until your project is free of bugs and well tested!

If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages.
